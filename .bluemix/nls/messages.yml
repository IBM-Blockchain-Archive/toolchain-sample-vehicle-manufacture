template.name: "Setup Vehicle Manufacturing with an IBM Blockchain network"
template.description: "**Step 0.**\n Once created this toolchain will make a Vehicle Manufacturing application and use either a new or existing blockchain network. First we need to create the toolchain.  This will consist of a Git clone of Vehicle Manufacturing, the Vehicle Manufacturing app, and a Delivery Pipeline for continuous integration. These items are already ready to go below. We can also configure them at a later time. For now click the icons below \"Tool Integrations\" to familiarize yourself with what we are creating. **Don't worry, you don't _need_ to change anything.** \n\nThe components in this toolchain will be created and stored under the selected IBM Cloud organization/space.  Leave the org/space setting alone if you are unsure of which to use.  \n\n**Step 1.** To get going, click the **Create** button on the bottom.\n\n**Step 2 & 3.** On the next page you will be able to see your Vehicle Manufacturing application building. Onces its complete you can open Vehicle Manufacturing."
template.gettingStarted: "Your toolchain is ready! A new build of Vehicle Manufacturing is underway. **Click the \"Delivery Pipeline\" tile below to see the build's status.** Then once it's done click the **Vehicle Manufacturing** tile below."
